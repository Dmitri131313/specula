# Contributions
If you are considering contributing to our repository, first thank you for doing so! </br>

Contributions from community members are more than welcome, there are a few items that you should be aware of for a smooth process </br>

At this time we will not be accepting new functional changes to the provided COM object.  If you find an error in the 
existing code we will accept a pull to fix that within the COM object.

## Technique Expectations
* Capabilities should run without causing outlook.exe to lock up.
* Capabilities should acount for errors that may occur and handle them

## Code Expectations
* python code should be coded to work from version 3.9 to 3.11
* Any additions to helperFunctions should be well-formed and usable from other vbs scripts
* Removal of intentionally placed IOC's will be rejected
* Again any updates to code under api/* should be error correcting in nature only, not feature additions.

## What to expect as a contributor
After your contribution is received, it will receive an in-depth code review and testing.  </br>
After testing is completed, we will have zero or more rounds of change requests based on findings until there are no issues in the code.  At that point it will be accepted into the repository, and your github username will be added to our credit list (if you would prefer not to be added or some other handle to be used, just let me know)
